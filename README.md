# Tech Stock Multi-Step Forecasting with Enhanced SARIMAX

## Overview

This project implements **multi-step ahead forecasting** (7-day, 14-day, and 30-day horizons) for tech stocks using SARIMAX models with **truly exogenous variables**. Unlike trivial 1-step predictions, our approach provides actionable medium-term forecasts for investment decisions.

**Date Range:** 2019-01-01 to 2025-11-21
**Frequency:** Daily stock data
**Companies:** 24 AI/tech companies across multiple sectors
**Forecast Horizons:** 7, 14, and 30 days ahead

### Key Features

- **Multi-Step Forecasting**: Direct forecasting at 7, 14, and 30-day horizons
- **Truly Exogenous Variables**: Only variables determined outside the tech sector (no NASDAQ, tech ETFs)
- **Conservative Selection**: 3-5 variables maximum via AIC/BIC-based forward selection
- **Rigorous Validation**: Baseline comparisons, walk-forward validation, overfitting checks
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: RMSE, MAE, R², directional accuracy vs baseline ARIMA

## Truly Exogenous Variable Selection

### What Makes a Variable "Truly Exogenous"?

For a variable to be valid in our forecasting model, it must meet **all three criteria**:

1. **Determined outside the tech sector** - Not influenced by the stocks we're predicting
2. **Causally prior** - Influences tech stocks but tech stocks don't influence it
3. **Observable at prediction time** - No future peeking or data leakage

### Valid Exogenous Candidates

✅ **Market-Wide Volatility:**
- **VIX** - SPX options-implied volatility (market-wide, not tech-specific)
- **High_Volatility_Regime** - Binary indicator for extreme market stress

✅ **Interest Rates & Macro (Set by Fed/Bond Market):**
- **Treasury_10Y** - Risk-free rate benchmark
- **Treasury_3M** - Short-term rate
- **Yield_Curve_Slope** - 10Y-3M spread (recession indicator)
- **Yield_Curve_Inverted** - Binary recession signal
- **Dollar_Index** - USD currency strength

✅ **Commodities (Separate Markets):**
- **Gold** - Safe haven demand
- **Oil_WTI** - Energy/inflation proxy
- **Bitcoin** - Crypto risk appetite (debatable but separate asset class)

✅ **Regime Indicators (Binary Flags):**
- **AI_Boom_Period** - Post-ChatGPT era (Nov 2022+)
- **Fed_Hike_Period** - Rate hiking cycle
- **Tech_Bear_2022** - 2022 tech sell-off

### INVALID Variables (Endogenous/Circular)

❌ **NASDAQ, NASDAQ_100_ETF** - **Contains our target stocks!** Using NASDAQ to predict tech stocks is circular since tech stocks ARE NASDAQ.

❌ **Tech Sector ETFs** - Semiconductor_ETF, Software_ETF, Cloud_Computing_ETF, etc. literally contain the stocks we're forecasting.

❌ **Sector Fundamentals** - Profit margins, ROE, etc. are **outcomes**, not drivers. They're determined BY the stocks, not external to them.

### Final Model Uses 3-5 Variables Maximum

Through AIC/BIC-based forward selection, we choose only the most predictive variables that provide incremental information. Typical final models include:
- VIX (market volatility)
- Treasury rates or yield curve slope
- Dollar Index or commodity
- 1-2 regime indicators

## Methodology

### Feature Selection Process

**Conservative, AIC/BIC-Based Approach:**

1. **Candidate Pool**: Only truly exogenous variables (11 candidates max)
2. **Baseline Comparison**: Train ARIMA(1,1,1) with no exogenous variables
3. **Forward Selection**: Add variables one at a time via AIC minimization
4. **Stopping Rule**: Stop when AIC improvement < 2.0 or reached 5 variables
5. **Final Model**: Typically 3-5 variables selected

**Why This Approach:**
- **AIC/BIC penalize complexity** - Prevents overfitting
- **Forward selection** - Only adds variables that genuinely improve prediction
- **Hard limit of 5 variables** - Forces parsimony
- **Baseline comparison** - Validates that exogenous variables actually help

### Multi-Step Forecasting Approach

We implement **direct multi-step forecasting** rather than 1-step ahead:

- **7-Day Model**: Predicts stock index value 7 days into the future
  - Use case: Short-term trading strategies, options positioning
  - Expected accuracy: Highest among the three horizons

- **14-Day Model**: Predicts stock index value 14 days ahead
  - Use case: Medium-term portfolio adjustments, swing trading
  - Expected accuracy: Moderate (natural degradation with longer horizon)

- **30-Day Model**: Predicts stock index value 30 days ahead
  - Use case: Strategic allocation decisions, trend identification
  - Expected accuracy: Lower but still actionable for trend direction

### Model Architecture

**SARIMAX(1, 1, 1) x (0, 0, 0, 0)**
- AR(1): Autoregressive component captures momentum
- I(1): First-order differencing for stationarity
- MA(1): Moving average component for shock absorption
- No seasonality: Daily data doesn't exhibit strong seasonal patterns

### Evaluation Metrics

1. **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: Point prediction accuracy
2. **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Average error magnitude
3. **R² Score**: Proportion of variance explained
4. **Directional Accuracy**: Percentage of correct up/down predictions (often most useful)

## Results & Insights

### Validation Approach

1. **Baseline Comparison**: Every model compared to ARIMA-only baseline
2. **Walk-Forward Validation**: 5 rolling windows to test temporal stability
3. **Out-of-Sample Testing**: 15% holdout set never used in training or selection
4. **AIC/BIC Metrics**: Model complexity penalized appropriately

### Expected Performance Patterns

- **7-day forecasts**: Best accuracy, modest improvement over baseline (5-15% RMSE reduction)
- **14-day forecasts**: Moderate accuracy, smaller improvement over baseline
- **30-day forecasts**: Lower accuracy but may still beat baseline for trend direction
- **Directional accuracy**: Often more important than point predictions for trading

### Key Findings

1. **Exogeneity Matters**: Using truly exogenous variables prevents spurious correlations
2. **Less is More**: 3-5 carefully selected variables outperform 10-15 variables
3. **VIX and Rates**: Market volatility and interest rates typically most predictive
4. **Regime Indicators Help**: Binary flags for AI Boom, Fed Hike periods add value
5. **Modest Improvements**: SARIMAX beats baseline but gains are incremental (not magical)

### Model Limitations & Warnings

- **Linear assumptions**: SARIMAX assumes linear relationships, may miss non-linear patterns
- **Structural breaks**: Regime changes can invalidate historical relationships
- **No guarantees**: Outperforming baseline in testing doesn't guarantee future performance
- **Overfitting risk**: Even with conservative selection, overfitting is possible
- **Requires retraining**: Model should be retrained monthly as new data arrives
- **Not financial advice**: This is an academic exercise, not investment guidance

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "EDA_Company Data.ipynb"
   ```

   - Load and explore the data
   - Identify truly exogenous variables (exclude NASDAQ, tech ETFs)
   - Perform AIC/BIC-based forward selection (max 5 variables)
   - Train baseline ARIMA models for comparison
   - Train 3 SARIMAX models (7, 14, 30-day horizons)
   - Run walk-forward validation to check overfitting

## Future Improvements

1. **Confidence Intervals**: Add probabilistic forecasts with prediction intervals
2. **Regime-Conditional Models**: Separate models for high/low volatility periods
3. **Ensemble with ML**: Combine SARIMAX with XGBoost/Random Forest (carefully avoiding overfitting)
4. **Alternative Exogenous**: Test commodity ratios, credit spreads, international rates
5. **Automated Retraining**: Monthly model updates with drift detection
6. **Shrinkage Methods**: Explore Bayesian SARIMAX for coefficient regularization

**Important**: Any improvements must maintain rigorous validation and avoid the endogeneity trap.
